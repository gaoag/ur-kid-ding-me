This was done as a self-directed final project in the advanced econometrics course at Berkeley (the highest level undergraduate metrics course offered). Focus is on instrumental variables analysis, causal inference, breaking regression assumptions, and applications to policy. "Cleaned up project.pdf" is the annotated and more organized report, so click that one.
