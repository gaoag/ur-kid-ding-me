This was done as a self-directed final project in the advanced econometrics course at Berkeley (the highest level undergraduate metrics course offered). Focus is on instrumental variables analysis, causal inference, breaking regression assumptions, and applications to policy. 

Analysis of US Census data from 2010, focusing on the decision to have more kids. I analyze the causal effect of having more children on earnings and the employment situation of parents, using samesex as an instrument (whether the first two children are both male/female). In this process, I experiment with the validity of different sets of control variables, and analyze (from an empirical and theoretical perspective) whether my choice of instrument is justified. I also use the CACE (complier average causal effect) framework to identify how this identified causation differs depending on initial characteristics of the mother. Finally, I do some boring stuff with LASSO (zzz).
